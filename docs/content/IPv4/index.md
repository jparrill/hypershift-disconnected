title: IPv4
---

This is one of the simplest network configurations for this type of deployment. We will primarily focus on IPv4 ranges, requiring fewer external components than IPv6 or dual-stack setups.

All the scripts provided contain either partial or complete automation to recreate the environment. To follow along, refer to the repository containing all the scripts for [IPv4 environments](https://github.com/jparrill/hypershift-disconnected/tree/main/assets/ipv4).
