title: IPv4
---

This is one of the most easiest network configurations for this kind of deployment, we will keep us focus on IPv4 ranges and we will need less external elements than IPv6 or Dual.

All the scripts provided will hold part or the whole automation to reproduce the environment. To do that this is the repository holding all the scripts for [IPv4 environments](https://github.com/jparrill/hypershift-disconnected/tree/main/assets/ipv4).
